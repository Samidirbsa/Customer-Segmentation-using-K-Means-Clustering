# Customer Segmentation for Marketing Strategies 

 

## Business Understanding 

 

### Introduction 

In the dynamic world of marketing, customer behavior analysis is crucial for businesses to tailor their strategies effectively. Customer segmentation, a key component of marketing analytics, allows for the categorization of customers into distinct groups with shared characteristics. This enables businesses to design personalized marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation. 

 

This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques, particularly leveraging purchasing behavior as the primary criterion. The goal is to identify patterns within the Mall Customer Segmentation Data that reveal insights into different customer personas, aiding businesses in understanding their customer base and developing targeted marketing strategies. 

 

### Objective 

The objective of this project is to use clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. 

 

## Data Manipulation Packages 

```python 

import pandas as pd 

import numpy as np 

Data Visualization Packages 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

import seaborn as sns 

import plotly.express as px 

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans 

Load Data 

# Load dataset from df_mall_customers DataFrame 

df_mall_customers = pd.read_csv('Dataset/Mall_Customers.csv') 

# Display the first 5 rows in DataFrame 

df_mall_customers.head() 

Univariate Data Analysis 

# Dropped the CustomerID as it was not important for our analysis 

del df_mall_customers['CustomerID'] 

# Visualizing the distribution of numerical variables 

df_mall_customers.hist(figsize=(12,8), grid=False) 

plt.show() 

Checking for Outliers 

# Set the size of the plot 

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) 

 
# Create a box plot for the 'Age' column 

sns.boxplot(x=df_mall_customers['Age'], orient='v', palette='viridis') 

plt.title('Box Plot of Age') 

plt.ylabel('Age') 

plt.show() 

Choosing the Annual Income Column & Spending Score Column 

# Extract columns for Annual Income and Spending Score 

x = df_mall_customers.iloc[:, [2, 3]].values 

Clustering Techniques 

Here, we would apply clustering techniques such as KMeans to segment the customers based on the selected features.
